# Payment Flow (React + TypeScript + Vite)

## To run:

1. Clone the repo locally. Make sure you have node + npm installed.
2. Run `npm i` from command line to install the necessary packages.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the app. It should be running at `http://localhost:5173`.


Note:
I think something isn't quite right with the jest + vite configuration so I haven't been able to get the jest tests to run. Given more time, hopefully I could figure out what's up, but apologies for that!

Thanks for taking the time to check this out! :sparkles:
